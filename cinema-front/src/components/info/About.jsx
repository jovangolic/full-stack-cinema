                        a comedy night, or a quiet drama, we've got something for every mood.
                        Sit back. Relax. Let the story take you away.
                    And hey, if the movie doesn't do the trick, just head across the street to the Feisty Goat Tavern. 
                    A good drink might just finish what the credits couldn't.
